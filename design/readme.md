## Power tree schematic

> A power tree is a graphical representation of your systemâ€™s power management architecture. The power tree illustrates the main supply power flow through a tree of power converters that convert the main supply power to the voltage and current required to drive various loads. - Intel's Creating an FPGA Power Tree
