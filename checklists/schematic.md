# Schematic

## Good schematic checklist

- [ ] Separate double wire junctions
- [ ] Use dots for wire junctions, not crosses
- [ ] Make symbols for similar devices consistent E.g. resistors
- [ ] Name every part with a unique designator
- [ ] Align wires and components horizontally or vertically
- [ ] Label pin numbers on the outside of a symbol, signal names on the inside
- [ ] Place text orientation consistently E.g. horizontal
- [ ] Place components from left to right with a local flow
- [ ] Put higher voltage towards the top
- [ ] Put positive voltages `Vcc` up and negative voltages `GND` down
- [ ] Separate schematic into logical blocks
- [ ] Make the schematic fit in A4 or A3 standard sized papers
- [ ] Place decoupling capacitors next to their devices
- [ ] Keep names reasonably short
- [ ] Use uppercase symbol names

## Title blocks

- [ ] Include name of the circuit
- [ ] Include name of the schematic designer
- [ ] Include date of creation
- [ ] Include page of the schematic
- [ ] Include revision number
