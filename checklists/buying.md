# Buying

> Before buying a breakout board, component, etc.

## Chips

- [ ] What protocols does it support? `I2C`, `SPI`, etc
- [ ] What firmware can it run?
- [ ] If it is a breakout board, can the single components be bought for future use?
- [ ] Type of packages available
- [ ] Example projects
- [ ] Mechanical dimensions
- [ ] Pitch size
- [ ] Number of pins
- [ ] Manufacturer part number
- [ ] Link to datasheet
- [ ] Are the firmware tools supported on macOSX?

## MCU
